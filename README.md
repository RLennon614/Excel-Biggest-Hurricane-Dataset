# Excel-Biggest-Hurricane-Dataset
Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on the Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes based on historical data. The project utilizes Excel to perform sorting, ranking, calculations, and data visualization to derive insights into the strongest and most impactful tropical cyclones.

This serves as a practical demonstration of advanced spreadsheet skills in data cleaning, analysis, and presentation.

💾 Dataset
The analysis is based on the following dataset, which should be included in this repository:

File: Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes.csv (or the corresponding .xlsx file)

Content: Contains data fields likely including:

Name of the Hurricane

Year

Category (Saffir-Simpson)

Minimum Pressure (mbar)

Maximum Sustained Wind Speed (mph or knots)

Date/Time of Peak Intensity (Assumed)

✨ Features Demonstrated
The Excel workbook demonstrates expertise in the following key areas:

I. Data Manipulation & Formulas
Sorting and Ranking: Sorting hurricanes by various metrics (e.g., Minimum Pressure or Wind Speed) to establish ranks.

Statistical Functions (e.g., AVERAGE, MIN, MAX): Calculating central tendencies and extreme values for key metrics across the dataset.

Conditional Logic (e.g., IF, SUMIF): Performing calculations or applying logic based on specific criteria (e.g., summarizing data only for Category 5 storms).

II. Advanced Data Analysis
Pivot Tables: Summarizing storm counts by Category, decade, or region to identify trends.

III. Formatting and Usability
Conditional Formatting: Highlighting critical values, such as the lowest minimum pressure records.

Data Validation and Cleanup: Ensuring data integrity before analysis.

🛠️ How to View and Reproduce
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [Your Repository URL]
Open the File: Open the primary analysis file (e.g., Hurricane_Analysis_Workbook.xlsx) in Microsoft Excel.

Explore the Sheets: Navigate between the sheets to review the raw data, the formulas used, the pivot tables, and the final visualizations.

📌 Project Goals
Identify the hurricane with the lowest recorded minimum pressure.

Determine the average wind speed for Category 5 hurricanes.

Visualize the frequency of major hurricanes (Cat 3+) by decade.
